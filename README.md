# Quantum SVM's Cancerous Cell Detection -

Conducting two simulations testing on how the Quantum Support Vector Machine algorithm could potentially work on a real computer using IBM's Qiskit. 

The two simulations consisted of classifying if cells were benign or malignant based on a breast cancer dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The first simulation used conventional machine learning methods and a classical version of the SVM algorithm so the results could later be compared to the second simulation, where the quantum version of the SVM algorithm was used.
